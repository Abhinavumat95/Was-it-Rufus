You can run the code through terminal. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where git_status.py file is located.

On terminal type "python3 git_status.py" to run the code.

The code will first ask you whether you want to clone a repository to the local machine or not. Press 0 for No and 1 for Yes.

If you pressed 0, then it will ask you to enter the path where the repository is stored in your local machine.

If you pressed 1, then it will ask you to enter the path for your repository and the path of your local machine where you want to clone the repository.

Then it will print all the results for that repository.

An example of the results is as follows:

active branch:  main
local changes:  False
recent commit:  False
blame Rufus:  False
